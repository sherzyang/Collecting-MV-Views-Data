# Scraping Youtube Music Views

This jupyter notebook and text editor will together scrape a page listing videos on YouTube for view counts for individual music videos. It can be used across time to document changes in view count for many music videos. This is the starter code. There are still some additions to be made such as: 

1. For one timestamp, scraping views at that exact timestamp 
2. Automatic interval scraping for t1,t2,t3 etc.
